    <h1>BlogPost 2!</h1>
    <p>1.	Select a moment in the development of the www that you identify as important, <br> research it and write about it.
        •	I identify  Tim Berners-Lee’s founding of The World Wide Web Consortium in 1994 <br> as a crucial and important part of web history. This is the publishing of ‘working drafts’ by creators and developers. It is essentially reviewed by the online community and allows for commentary. This allows for bettering WD standards.  Benefits over time have included faster downloading times, lower upkeep expenses, a wider access to users; including those with disabilities, more user friendly etc.
        </p>
    <p>2.	A reflection on one of the historical articles provided.
        •	Alan Turing’s Computing Machinery and Intelligence work focuses on the consideration <br> of the question “Can machines think?” and suggests that there is ultimately no substantial evidence supporting that machines cannot in fact think logically like humans. He believes that various methods can be taken in order to develop machine intelligence. 
        Whilst I disagree that computers can currently think like humans, I do agree that we can <br> pave the way for such advancements. Currently I believe that technology is not yet as advanced, simply consisting of keywords and coding in order to assist for human needs.

    <p>3.	The promise and peril of User Generated Content.
        •	The risks of user generated content may include the spill of content that companies <br> have spent hard work time and money for when brands decide to run UGC campaigns. There can be a lack of authenticity as endorsement deals are increasingly featuring famous people, ultimately cheapening the world of advertising. There are various potential legal issues. There has increasingly been an abundance of using photos and work without permission.
        •	The rewards of user generated content may include: an increase in web conversions, <br> advertisement based UGC allows for a rise in click-thru rates, it can result in a rise of returning user’s time spent by users on the site may increase significantly etc.
        </p>
    <p>4.	The link between changing technology and the development and spread of internet culture <br> (including but not limited to memes and fake news)
        •	Changing technology has ultimately allowed for all different types of users to gain <br> access and create their own content within the web itself. Due to an influx of such contributions, it has become impossible to prevent the spread of harmful and/or false news. Children and adolescents are gaining access to inappropriate media. There is also the dilemma of the dark web that is mainly used for illegal activity.
        </p>
    <p>5.	Research and decisions around URL structure
        •	The Uniform Research Locator allows users to identify various addresses of certain <br> documents/resources within the internet. They consist of various parts including protocols and domain names; allowing the browser to navigate and identify a resource. This not only creates unique URL’s that can simplify the searching of resources, but can also indicate the viability and safety of a website.
