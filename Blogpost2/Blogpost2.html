    <p>1.	Select a moment in the development of the www that you identify as important, <br> 
        research it and write about it. <br>
        •	I identify  Tim Berners-Lee’s founding of The World Wide Web Consortium in 1994 <br> 
        as a crucial and important part of web history. This is the publishing of ‘working <br>
        drafts’ by creators and developers. It is essentially reviewed by the online community <br> 
        and allows for commentary. This allows for bettering WD standards.  Benefits over <br>
        time have included faster downloading times, lower upkeep expenses, a wider access <br> 
        to users; including those with disabilities, more user friendly etc. <br>
        </p>
    <p>2.	A reflection on one of the historical articles provided. <br>
        •	Alan Turing’s Computing Machinery and Intelligence work focuses on the consideration <br> 
        of the question “Can machines think?” and suggests that there is ultimately no substantial <br> 
        evidence supporting that machines cannot in fact think logically like humans. He believes that <br> 
        various methods can be taken in order to develop machine intelligence. <br> 
        Whilst I disagree that computers can currently think like humans, I do agree that we can <br> 
        pave the way for such advancements. Currently I believe that technology is not yet as advanced, <br> 
        simply consisting of keywords and coding in order to assist for human needs. <br>
        </p>
    <p>3.	The promise and peril of User Generated Content. <br>
        •	The risks of user generated content may include the spill of content that companies <br> 
        have spent hard work time and money for when brands decide to run UGC campaigns. There <br> 
        can be a lack of authenticity as endorsement deals are increasingly featuring famous people, <br> 
        ultimately cheapening the world of advertising. There are various potential legal issues. <br> 
        There has increasingly been an abundance of using photos and work without permission. <br>
        •	The rewards of user generated content may include: an increase in web conversions, <br> 
        advertisement based UGC allows for a rise in click-thru rates, it can result in a rise <br> 
        of returning user’s time spent by users on the site may increase significantly etc. <br>
        </p>
    <p>4.	The link between changing technology and the development and spread of internet culture <br> 
        (including but not limited to memes and fake news) <br>
        •	Changing technology has ultimately allowed for all different types of users to gain <br> 
        access and create their own content within the web itself. Due to an influx of such <br> 
        contributions, it has become impossible to prevent the spread of harmful and/or false <br> 
        news. Children and adolescents are gaining access to inappropriate media. There is also <br> 
        the dilemma of the dark web that is mainly used for illegal activity. <br>
        </p>
    <p>5.	Research and decisions around URL structure <br>
        •	The Uniform Research Locator allows users to identify various addresses of certain <br> 
        documents/resources within the internet. They consist of various parts including protocols <br> 
        and domain names; allowing the browser to navigate and identify a resource. This not only <br> 
        creates unique URL’s that can simplify the searching of resources, but can also indicate <br> 
        the viability and safety of a website. <br>
