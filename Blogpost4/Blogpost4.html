    <p><h2>1.	How does the Medium is the Message impact our understanding of the web?</h2></p>
    <p>Marshal McLuhan’s work, The Medium is the Message demonstrates to readers how artefacts as media have the capability to influence any society by their attributes or substance.</p>
    <p>It essentially influences and provides clarity for us, the web designers as to how we can approach the design of the web in the most appealing and functional way possible. It allows us to make thought through and educated decisions on what medium would be best suited for our audiences and intentions. For example; one would look for the most efficient browser that has sufficient speed in order to create a more desirable and user friendly experience. </p>
    <p>The browser would also need to be well known, or well-advertised in order to encourage users or to receive an adequate flow of visibility whereby users can easily find our webpages. It also helps us understand user experiences through different mediums such as through film versus the web, as film is more linear, whereby users participate and experience it from beginning to middle to end; however the web is seldom experienced through a linear experience, the user is in more control as to where they want to go, what they want to see and ultimately can navigate directly to what they came for. It is entirely up to the user how they decide to experience and consume the information being provided. </p>
    <p>Another thing whilst looking at medium is accessibility. One can also look at the web not only as a medium, but as a message: users can now access the web globally and from anywhere within the comfort of their own home; unlike newspapers that prove to be far more restrictive whereby readers will have to wait for delivery and accessibility is far more circumstantial; however I this day and age, one can gain access to news instantly, as soon as the article has been publishes. Through the use of computers and cell phones, one can also dictate the brightness and use filters such as the ‘blue light’ filter for further comfort. </p>
    <p>Most importantly, web designers have the capability to produce tools, experiences, services and societies due to the medium that is being used. Historically, no other medium to date has the capability to reach as many individuals on such a global scale. It forces us designers to account and keep in mind its accessibility, reach and immediate gratification. </p>
    <p>As designers we need to look at the best means of delivering information dependant of the job or assignment given. Through the use of the web, a small store can gain far more coverage and an access to a wider group of clients; however in a small town of mostly elderly individuals that are not technologically sufficient, the newspaper may be a greater form of communicating to potential, nearby clients.</p>
