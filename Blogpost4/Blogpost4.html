    <h1>BlogPost Number 4!</h1>
    <p><h2>1.	How does the Medium is the Message impact our understanding of the web?</h2></p>
    <p>Marshal McLuhan’s work, The Medium is the Message demonstrates to readers how artefacts as media <br> 
        have the capability to influence any society by their attributes or substance.</p>
    <p>It essentially influences and provides clarity for us, the web designers as to how we can approach <br> 
        the design of the web in the most appealing and functional way possible. It allows us to make <br> 
        thought through and educated decisions on what medium would be best suited for our audiences and <br> 
        intentions. For example; one would look for the most efficient browser that has sufficient speed <br> 
        in order to create a more desirable and user friendly experience. </p>
    <p>The browser would also need to be well known, or well-advertised in order to encourage users or to <br> 
        receive an adequate flow of visibility whereby users can easily find our webpages. It also helps us <br> 
        understand user experiences through different mediums such as through film versus the web, as film <br> 
        is more linear, whereby users participate and experience it from beginning to middle to end; however <br> 
        the web is seldom experienced through a linear experience, the user is in more control as to where <br> 
        they want to go, what they want to see and ultimately can navigate directly to what they came for. <br> 
        It is entirely up to the user how they decide to experience and consume the information being provided. </p>
    <p>Another thing whilst looking at medium is accessibility. One can also look at the web not only as a <br> 
        medium, but as a message: users can now access the web globally and from anywhere within the comfort <br> 
        of their own home; unlike newspapers that prove to be far more restrictive whereby readers will have <br> 
        to wait for delivery and accessibility is far more circumstantial; however I this day and age, one <br> 
        can gain access to news instantly, as soon as the article has been publishes. Through the use of <br> 
        computers and cell phones, one can also dictate the brightness and use filters such as the ‘blue light’ <br> 
        filter for further comfort. </p>
    <p>Most importantly, web designers have the capability to produce tools, experiences, services and <br> 
        societies due to the medium that is being used. Historically, no other medium to date has the <br> 
        capability to reach as many individuals on such a global scale. It forces us designers to account <br> 
        and keep in mind its accessibility, reach and immediate gratification. </p>
    <p>As designers we need to look at the best means of delivering information dependant of the job or <br> 
        assignment given. Through the use of the web, a small store can gain far more coverage and an <br> 
        access to a wider group of clients; however in a small town of mostly elderly individuals that <br> 
        are not technologically sufficient, the newspaper may be a greater form of communicating to <br> 
        potential, nearby clients.</p>
