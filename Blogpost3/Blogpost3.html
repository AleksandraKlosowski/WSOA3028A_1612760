    <p>1.	Semantic Markup - what is it and why is it necessary
        •	Semantic markup is a particular way in which one will structure and write <br> their HTML coding in order to reinforce the division of etymology and logic involved with meaning. This in particular has to do with the content of the HTML as opposed to appearance. This is important as it allows one to navigate easily through their code and make effective changes when necessary. It is also particularly helpful when working with a team as it allows for others to navigate and understand your code within its content; essentially making it easy to distinguish between different types of data.

    <p>2.	What is a browser? How do they work?
        •	A browser is a computer program that contains a graphical user interface for <br> the use of presenting and navigating between various web pages. More specifically it is an application software that provides a user with access to the World Wide Web. This application/browser retrieves wanted and searched for content from a web server and allows for the user to view it on their particular device whether it be a cell phone, a laptop etc.

    <p>3.	What are URLs and how do they work?
        •	A URL or ‘Uniform Resource Locator’ is the address of a web page usually <br> beginning with https:// for trustworthy and secure web pages. It is a reference to a web source that helps the user identify its location within a computer network and is a means of retrieving it. How it works is that it is a set of directions that can be interpreted through various platforms and they ultimately point and direct to a resource. This is done through a code-like language that consists of a protocol, a subdomain, a root domain, a top-level-domain, a subfolder, a file and a parameter; ultimately allowing the browser to navigate to the desired page.

    <p>4.	A reflection on McLuhan, M. ‘The Medium is the Message’
        •	Mcluhan suggests that the class of a medium is vastly more significant than the <br> meaning or substance of the message. He states that a ‘message’ is “the change of scale or pace or pattern” that it “introduces into human affairs.” Personally I agree with this statement as it provides the readers with an abundance of knowledge and communicates information. It informs us about what is happening globally and around us.

    <p>5.	A reflection on Wardrip-Fruin, N. ‘What Hypertext Is’
        •	Wardrip-Fruin Nelson looks particularly at definitions constructed by Theodor Holm, <br> the definitions being  “A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate”  and “‘Hypertext’ means forms of writing which branch or perform on request; they are best presented on computer display screens... Discrete, or chunk style, hypertexts consist of separate pieces of text connected by links.” (Holm in Nelson pg 127)
        
        This is particularly true as hypertext overall is when text is displayed on the screen <br> of a computer or alternative electronic device and references other texts that can be accessed instantly by the reader.
