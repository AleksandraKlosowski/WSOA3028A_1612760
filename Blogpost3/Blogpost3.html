    <p>1.	Semantic Markup - what is it and why is it necessary <br>
        •	Semantic markup is a particular way in which one will structure and write <br> 
        their HTML coding in order to reinforce the division of etymology and logic <br> 
        involved with meaning. This in particular has to do with the content of the HTML <br> 
        as opposed to appearance. This is important as it allows one to navigate easily <br> 
        through their code and make effective changes when necessary. It is also particularly <br> 
        helpful when working with a team as it allows for others to navigate and understand <br> 
        your code within its content; essentially making it easy to distinguish between <br> 
        different types of data. <br>
        </p>
    <p>2.	What is a browser? How do they work? <br>
        •	A browser is a computer program that contains a graphical user interface for <br> 
        the use of presenting and navigating between various web pages. More specifically <br> 
        it is an application software that provides a user with access to the World Wide Web. <br> 
        This application/browser retrieves wanted and searched for content from a web server <br> 
        and allows for the user to view it on their particular device whether it be a cell  phone, <br> 
        a laptop etc. <br>
        </p>
    <p>3.	What are URLs and how do they work? <br>
        •	A URL or ‘Uniform Resource Locator’ is the address of a web page usually <br> 
        beginning with https:// for trustworthy and secure web pages. It is a reference <br> 
        to a web source that helps the user identify its location within a computer network <br> 
        and is a means of retrieving it. How it works is that it is a set of directions that <br> 
        can be interpreted through various platforms and they ultimately point and direct to <br> 
        a resource. This is done through a code-like language that consists of a protocol, a <br> 
        subdomain, a root domain, a top-level-domain, a subfolder, a file and a parameter; <br> 
        ultimately allowing the browser to navigate to the desired page. <br>
        </p>
    <p>4.	A reflection on McLuhan, M. ‘The Medium is the Message’ <br>
        •	Mcluhan suggests that the class of a medium is vastly more significant than the <br> 
        meaning or substance of the message. He states that a ‘message’ is “the change of <br> 
        scale or pace or pattern” that it “introduces into human affairs.” Personally I agree <br> 
        with this statement as it provides the readers with an abundance of knowledge and <br> 
        communicates information. It informs us about what is happening globally and around us. <br>
        </p>
    <p>5.	A reflection on Wardrip-Fruin, N. ‘What Hypertext Is’ <br>
        •	Wardrip-Fruin Nelson looks particularly at definitions constructed by Theodor Holm, <br> 
        the definitions being  “A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the <br> 
        Indeterminate”  and “‘Hypertext’ means forms of writing which branch or perform on <br> 
        request; they are best presented on computer display screens... Discrete, or chunk <br> 
        style, hypertexts consist of separate pieces of text connected by links.” (Holm in Nelson pg 127) <br>
        
        This is particularly true as hypertext overall is when text is displayed on the screen <br> 
        of a computer or alternative electronic device and references other texts that can be <br> 
        accessed instantly by the reader. <br>
