                        Our Locations
                    </h2>
                    <p style="text-align:right;">Our main location is in Mellvie, Johanesburg, South Africa. Aplace where creatives tend to gravitate with an adundance of vintage stores, unique restaurants and even little drug stores. We have 2 floristries in Johannesburg ad 1 in Cape Town. Johanneburg. Johannesburg is the largest cirty within South Africa that started off with its gold-mining industry within the 19th century.<br> <br> 
                    Johannesburg has been rebuilt four times, starting as a campsite with tents, which later evolved into a small town filled with shacks; shortly after four story buildings started being introduced until it finally became the city that we know today; a city filled with contemporary skyscrapers.</p>

                        Our Shop History
                    </h2>
                    <p style="text-align:left;">It was founded by my nonna Giulia in 1956. She was a traditional womomen from the town of Napoli in Italy, Italy's largest city. She immigrated to South Africa with her father Vincenzo. In Napoli, nonna learnt to cook at a very young age as her father was consistently working and her mother was no longer alive. Napoli was a relatively quiet place so she spent most of her time endulging in her hobbies: gardening. She grew such a passion for flowers, herbs and shrubbery that she spent all of her savings on opening the shop we know today. It was called Nonna's Flowers. Being born here, I felt the need to rename and revamp the shop for a more modern and personalized feel; hence the use of "jinne" in our name. </p>
