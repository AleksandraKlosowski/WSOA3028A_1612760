                        When elaborating on the ideas and ideals of the internet; one could be referring 
                        to its overall vastness of information that appears to be limitless. Whereby all 
                        of the world’s current knowledge is currently stored; and is continuously being updated. 
                        This continuous addition to the internet shows that although the internet appears  
                        limitless, as if to already contain every version of every piece of information.</p>
                    <p>When looking at the Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges, this is suggesting that 
                        within this library, any possible word, phrase or combination within the English
                        language exists. This is done through multiple possibilities being created by trying 
                        out every possible variation created with the letters of the English language; showing 
                        us that every possible phrase, sentence or word already exists. This is similar to  
                        the internet by expressing its limitlessness and how there can never really be truly 
                        new information; even more so through the fact that one can actually google the library
                        of babel and type any word/phrase on this page and will undeniably found that it will  
                        exist within this library. Scientists for example are continuously learning and expanding 
                        on their studies and thus contributing to the added information within the internet; 
                        however due to the limitlessness of the library of babel, ironically these new 
                        discoveries should already be within the library of babel since it contains every
                        possible formula within the English language. Therefore, if the library of babel is
                        already on the internet, there really can never be any new information, but rather 
                        exposed information that can already be found within this library. </p>
                        <p>When looking at The Garden of Forking Paths by Jorge Luis Borges, one is looking at 
                        an elaborate maze, a labyrinth of sorts. It is said that the book itself not only 
                        explains the philosophy of the vast variations of storylines but is also a maze itself, 
                        with its vast and endless interpretations. This is whereby a lot of stories and versions 
                        of a narrative exist simultaneously, as if to express vast timelines that could branch out 
                        dependant of ones choices, much like ones experience on the internet. Similarly the internet
                        is a labyrinth; whereby depending on your keywords and choice of search, you will find various 
                        different pages and have a vast access to different types of knowledge. Just like the vast  
                        choices and routes one can take within a labyrinth; one similarly leads themselves through 
                        various paths on the internet dependant on what they click on, and where they try gain 
                        access to. One could end up with a nasty virus, or have successfully downloaded their
                        pirated movie. The internet is vast and is expressive of how large the world of information
                        and misinformation. As much as the world allows us to gain access to multitudes of studies 
                        and knowledge, it can easily deceive the public due to the fact that it equally contains 
                        false information. </p>
                    <p>The main feature that perhaps makes the internet appear smaller and more censored is
                        due to algorithms that will pop up the most searched sites and pages; where it will 
                        filter out the less desired information that one can find by sifting through various 
                        pages such as within a Google search.</p>

                <p>1.</b>	Select a moment in the development of the www that you identify as important, 
                    research it and write about it.<br>
                    •	I identify  Tim Berners-Lee’s founding of The World Wide Web Consortium in 1994
                    as a crucial and important part of web history. This is the publishing of ‘working 
                    drafts’ by creators and developers. It is essentially reviewed by the online community
                    and allows for commentary. This allows for bettering WD standards.  Benefits over
                    time have included faster downloading times, lower upkeep expenses, a wider access 
                    to users; including those with disabilities, more user friendly etc.
                    </p>
                <p>2.</b>	A reflection on one of the historical articles provided. <br>
                    •	Alan Turing’s Computing Machinery and Intelligence work focuses on the consideration 
                    of the question “Can machines think?” and suggests that there is ultimately no substantial 
                    evidence supporting that machines cannot in fact think logically like humans. He believes that 
                    various methods can be taken in order to develop machine intelligence. 
                    Whilst I disagree that computers can currently think like humans, I do agree that we can
                    pave the way for such advancements. Currently I believe that technology is not yet as advanced,
                    simply consisting of keywords and coding in order to assist for human needs. 
                    </p>
                <p>3.</b>	The promise and peril of User Generated Content. <br>
                    •	The risks of user generated content may include the spill of content that companies 
                    have spent hard work time and money for when brands decide to run UGC campaigns. There  
                    can be a lack of authenticity as endorsement deals are increasingly featuring famous people, 
                    ultimately cheapening the world of advertising. There are various potential legal issues. 
                    There has increasingly been an abundance of using photos and work without permission. <br>
                    •	The rewards of user generated content may include: an increase in web conversions, 
                    advertisement based UGC allows for a rise in click-thru rates, it can result in a rise 
                    of returning user’s time spent by users on the site may increase significantly etc. 
                    </p>
                <p>4.</b>	The link between changing technology and the development and spread of internet culture
                    (including but not limited to memes and fake news) <br>
                    •	Changing technology has ultimately allowed for all different types of users to gain 
                    access and create their own content within the web itself. Due to an influx of such 
                    contributions, it has become impossible to prevent the spread of harmful and/or false  
                    news. Children and adolescents are gaining access to inappropriate media. There is also 
                    the dilemma of the dark web that is mainly used for illegal activity. 
                    </p>
                <p>5.</b>	Research and decisions around URL structure <br>
                    •	The Uniform Research Locator allows users to identify various addresses of certain 
                    documents/resources within the internet. They consist of various parts including protocols 
                    and domain names; allowing the browser to navigate and identify a resource. This not only 
                    creates unique URL’s that can simplify the searching of resources, but can also indicate 
                    the viability and safety of a website.

                    <p>
                        1.</b>	Semantic Markup - what is it and why is it necessary <br>
                        •	Semantic markup is a particular way in which one will structure and write
                        their HTML coding in order to reinforce the division of etymology and logic 
                        involved with meaning. This in particular has to do with the content of the HTML 
                        as opposed to appearance. This is important as it allows one to navigate easily 
                        through their code and make effective changes when necessary. It is also particularly 
                        helpful when working with a team as it allows for others to navigate and understand 
                        your code within its content; essentially making it easy to distinguish between
                        different types of data. 
                        </p>
                    <p>2.</b>	What is a browser? How do they work? <br>
                        •	A browser is a computer program that contains a graphical user interface for 
                        the use of presenting and navigating between various web pages. More specifically 
                        it is an application software that provides a user with access to the World Wide Web.
                        This application/browser retrieves wanted and searched for content from a web server
                        and allows for the user to view it on their particular device whether it be a cell  phone, 
                        a laptop etc. 
                    </p>
                    <p>3.</b>	What are URLs and how do they work? <br>
                        •	A URL or ‘Uniform Resource Locator’ is the address of a web page usually <br> 
                        beginning with https:// for trustworthy and secure web pages. It is a reference                             
                        to a web source that helps the user identify its location within a computer network 
                        and is a means of retrieving it. How it works is that it is a set of directions that 
                        can be interpreted through various platforms and they ultimately point and direct to 
                        a resource. This is done through a code-like language that consists of a protocol, a 
                        subdomain, a root domain, a top-level-domain, a subfolder, a file and a parameter; 
                        ultimately allowing the browser to navigate to the desired page. 
                    </p>
                    <p><b>4.</b>	A reflection on McLuhan, M. ‘The Medium is the Message’ <br>
                        •	Mcluhan suggests that the class of a medium is vastly more significant than the 
                        meaning or substance of the message. He states that a ‘message’ is “the change of 
                        scale or pace or pattern” that it “introduces into human affairs.” Personally I agree 
                        with this statement as it provides the readers with an abundance of knowledge and 
                        communicates information. It informs us about what is happening globally and around us.                           
                    </p>
                    <p><b>5.</b>	A reflection on Wardrip-Fruin, N. ‘What Hypertext Is’ <br>
                        •	Wardrip-Fruin Nelson looks particularly at definitions constructed by Theodor Holm, 
                        the definitions being  “A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the 
                        Indeterminate”  and “‘Hypertext’ means forms of writing which branch or perform on  
                        request; they are best presented on computer display screens... Discrete, or chunk  
                        style, hypertexts consist of separate pieces of text connected by links.” (Holm in Nelson pg 127) 
                        This is particularly true as hypertext overall is when text is displayed on the screen 
                        of a computer or alternative electronic device and references other texts that can be 
                        accessed instantly by the reader.

                        Blogpost Number 4: <h3>How does the Medium is the Message impact our understanding of the web?</h3>
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                                <!--blogposts-->
                    <p>Marshal McLuhan’s work, The Medium is the Message demonstrates to readers how artefacts as media 
                        have the capability to influence any society by their attributes or substance.
                        It essentially influences and provides clarity for us, the web designers as to how we can approach
                        the design of the web in the most appealing and functional way possible. It allows us to make 
                        thought through and educated decisions on what medium would be best suited for our audiences and 
                        intentions. For example; one would look for the most efficient browser that has sufficient speed 
                        in order to create a more desirable and user friendly experience. 
                        The browser would also need to be well known, or well-advertised in order to encourage users or to 
                        receive an adequate flow of visibility whereby users can easily find our webpages. It also helps us 
                        understand user experiences through different mediums such as through film versus the web, as film
                        is more linear, whereby users participate and experience it from beginning to middle to end; however  
                        the web is seldom experienced through a linear experience, the user is in more control as to where 
                        they want to go, what they want to see and ultimately can navigate directly to what they came for. 
                        It is entirely up to the user how they decide to experience and consume the information being provided. 
                    <p>Another thing whilst looking at medium is accessibility. One can also look at the web not only as a 
                        medium, but as a message: users can now access the web globally and from anywhere within the comfort 
                        of their own home; unlike newspapers that prove to be far more restrictive whereby readers will have 
                        to wait for delivery and accessibility is far more circumstantial; however I this day and age, one 
                        can gain access to news instantly, as soon as the article has been publishes. Through the use of 
                        computers and cell phones, one can also dictate the brightness and use filters such as the ‘blue light’
                        filter for further comfort. </p>
                    <p>Most importantly, web designers have the capability to produce tools, experiences, services and 
                        societies due to the medium that is being used. Historically, no other medium to date has the 
                        capability to reach as many individuals on such a global scale. It forces us designers to account  
                        and keep in mind its accessibility, reach and immediate gratification.
                        As designers we need to look at the best means of delivering information dependant of the job or  
                        assignment given. Through the use of the web, a small store can gain far more coverage and an
                        access to a wider group of clients; however in a small town of mostly elderly individuals that 
                        are not technologically sufficient, the newspaper may be a greater form of communicating to 
                        potential, nearby clients.</p>

        <p><h2>The importance of Accessibility</h2></p>
        <p>The web has become the most popularized form of medium, giving us access to vital 
            resources that comprise of all the aspects within our lives. The web allows us to 
            gain complete accessibility to various areas such as healthcare, schooling, looking
            for jobs, shopping online, entertainment and much more. Therefore it is vastly
            important that everyone has access to the internet. </p>
        <p>Having access to the web can assist various types of individuals such as those with 
            disabilities and essentially can improve life’s experiences for everyone. The 
            internet also allows us to find the easiest means of communication and allows us
            to communicate with others. This aids people who cannot physically go to a shop or 
            struggle to read on more traditional mediums such as print.</p>
        <p>Arguably, the most vital and often overlooked aspects of businesses often include 
            the lack of reachability for new customers due to a poor implementation of accessibility. 
            A businesses success can be greatly affected by the usability and accessibility of a website. 
            If customers cannot navigate through a website, it can be difficult to find the desired  
            services or items. It can also potentially irritate and infuriate potential customers, 
            often resulting in lost business. Furthermore, an inaccessible website can leave potential 
            for legal issues. </p>
        <p>Often a websites accessibility is dependant of its user interface and its respective 
            structure and design. Users should be able to search using keywords; and more specifically 
            for businesses, have an ease at contacting the business should there be any questions or queries.  
            The website should be structured in an aesthetic manner whereby many different types of clients 
            have a pleasant experience, whether it be the elderly or a teenager. This is done through the use 
            of headings, colours, icons, legible text, images, focus etc. </p>
        <p>The use of menus is also incredibly important. Menus should be easy to navigate through 
            by using keywords of the most important webpages and accesses within the website, as only 
            providing a search bar can be confusing and may result in a customer being unable to find 
            desired items as well as being able to have a knowledge of what is being offered. It is 
            through a websites functionality that develops a certain need and desire to use it. 
            Functionality should be all inclusive in order for a wider sense of engagement. This can 
            also be done by allowing the user to select a particular language in which one could display 
            the webpage; there could also be an option that allows a shopper to select the country with 
            which they reside which could show what is offered and available within their region; a further 
            bonus would be converting the prices into the consumers currency for ease. </p>
        <p>All in all, accessibility is one of if not the most important access to any type of user 
            and business.</p>

            <p><h2>The importance of Accessibility</h2></p>
            <p>
                This reading aside; the first thing one things of when it comes to digital inequalities 
                would/should perhaps be accessibility; this differs from country to country. Many individuals 
                do not have easy access to technology/ technological education and the internet. For example; 
                here in South Africa, the wealth gap is tremendously large, resulting in a larger poor population 
                that barely has access to clean water, let along digital technology. Furthermore we have power
                outages which unless you are a part of the upper classes, with generators and solar power; you may 
                not have access to electricity all the time due to the municipality.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to Luts, there are three variations of a digital divide: the first-level, second-level 
                and third. Exactly how one presumes what the substance of this article would be; Lutz in fact covers it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the first-level-she evaluates research and how its focus has become more and more dependable upon 
                the studies of access, skills, uses and outcomes. She emphasizes the impotence of a digital divide; 
                perhaps even resulting in the replacement for humans for that of virtual means (virtual assistants).
            </p>
            <p>
                It is further emphasized how limited most people are to that of digital discourse; which is become 
                ever so important with each year and living in a technological age. It is also important due to its 
                easy accessibility and leisure as individuals are able to work from anywhere in the world in 
                whatever comfort they choose; whether it be at home, or in a coffee shop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within the second-level of discussion with regards to digital divide, this mostly covers the digital 
                economy. It is through a digital inequalities scholarship that more focus and discussion has arisen 
                about digital skills and uses within an analytical perspective. One could navigate just how many 
                individuals have a basic understanding of algorithms through surveys and experiments in order to 
                understand just how ‘behind’ we are as a population.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of the third-level divide, Lutz discusses just how new the research within the inequalities 
                of the digital world is; however it has already been researched through various impactful means.
                Thus being due to the considerations of technological access, skills and uses, but also the various 
                outcomes that result from the uses of technologies. It is equally as important to research both the 
                benefits and the harms of a technological world and more particularly, its consistent and constant evolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the thorough and multitudes of research given towards this topic; it is still underdeveloped
                and understudied. It is clear that it requires far more time dedicated to it due to its importance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Its disadvantages are still ridiculously unbalanced and need to have more time and resources dedicated 
                to the narrowing of this divide.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, it is vital in a digital area, for all students and individuals to learn about the basic
                vernaculars and understandings of technologies as well as being provided with access to it; realistically
                this will be the most dependable means of survival as in terms of income and dependence as other jobs 
                are slowly deteriorating. This has become an ever true statement with Covid19 and its limitations.

        <h2>User Experience:</h2></p>
            <a href="https://uxplanet.org/user-experience-design-in-digital-transformation-cc1923bcd2a">
            <img src="../img/ux.jpg" alt="user experiences" style="width:700px;height:400px;"></a>
        <p>
            Hassenzahl and Tractinsky take a deep discussion into the understandings of user Experience and question 
            what exactly it is and entails. This took place through the analysis of three varying perspectives. With 
            all of these perspectives contributing equally to our understandings of user experience within the 
            technological world as it is known today. However, even with these three perspectives, the writers feel that
             User Experience has not been sufficiently explain and described as it is far more intricate than we 
             often realize. User experience is arguably the most important part of web and software design. It is not 
             limited to needs that help us within our day to day lives; it is directly dependant on a user, including 
             and not limited to: needs, mood, motivation, expectations, technological discourse etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            They not only look at usability but also divulge into a world of context and setting with which the 
            interaction will occur. This results in a vast world of opportunities to forever improve and navigate through 
            needs, requirements and possible improvements in the creating of the very best website possible. The most 
            successful of user experiences make use of both investigation and practice. One cannot simply design a website
            without understanding what a user expects to get out and experience from it. One can also not simply create a
            website without testing it and making use of practice. We equally need to place ourselves in the user’s
            shoes in order to relate to them most effectively and create the most successful website possible. As the 
            technological world evolves, so does user experience; this is with the introduction of sound, graphics, 
            updates etc. it is these constant improvements that require artists and coders to stay updated and challenge
            ourselves by keeping up with the times and its respective expectations. Overall, this is what ultimately 
            improves functionality within the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also through this evolving system that there is a shift in expectations by developers, customers and users.
            Interestingly enough; developers now need to have a relatively efficient understanding of psychology as well.
            It is through this understanding that we allow ourselves to divulge into a user's perspective and ultimately 
            understand their overall experiences and therefore the effectiveness of a website. It also allows us to strive 
            for more positive user reactions and makes us more aware of how we might avoid negative ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, one could definitely argue that user experience is in fact the most vital role that plays within the 
            developing world of technology. Should a user have a negative or unsuccessful experience, they are unlikely to 
            visit the page again and can result in a loss or interest, interactivity and clients. Although we will strive for 
            an absence of negative experiences, it is equally if not more important to work towards improving quality of life 
            through ease and understanding of human limitations. This could be either by creating a user friendly website for 
            the elderly, children or the illiterate. Should there be opportunities to assist handicapable people, it would be 
            most important to do so.

        <h2>My UX & UI:</h2></p>
        <p>
            User interface typically refers to the medium with which we designers create. This refers to both the 
            machines and the software one uses; this can be computers, laptops, cellular phones etc. its main purpose 
            and area of specialty would be the creating of ease in terms of usage by even the most inexperienced of 
            users and to increase their user experience through aesthetics. The goal is to make a design as simple and
             effective as possible. This revolves around the term known as user-centred design. Appropriate user design 
             involves the use of fonts and formatting for appeal and easy legibility. The technical functions are just 
             as important as the appeal of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            User experience refers to the users overall interaction with the medium and their resulted experiences and 
            feelings. This is all about the user’s perception; how easy is it for them to use, how much does it appeal 
            to the eye, and does it communicate what is expected. User experience is more or less subjective and vague 
            than that of user interface. User experience is perhaps the most important thing when it comes to designing 
            a website. Once a website is made directly for a user’s needs, it is their experiences that make it most important.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of my websites user interface; I have used a laptop in order to create it, through the aid of Visual 
            Studio Code. Due to the accessibility to various type of coding capabilities; Visual Studio Code allows for 
            a large variety of ‘play’ and ‘interactivity’ with the software; allowing for vast variations of web design 
            and creative results. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My user experience however is in desperate need for improvement. Although my website is simple, and gets you 
            from one place to another, it does not allow a user to go back to previous home pages. The aesthetics are 
            amateur at best and I would like to make them more sleek and efficient through elegant typography and simple 
            designs. There are also vital gaps within my designs. I have not included contact information, or a home page 
            or even an appropriate setting for blogposts. (These comments are all with regards to my assignment 1 design 
            submission). My blogposts were each a link within a homepage whereas they should have all been easy to navigate
            on a separate entirely that one could get to from the home page through a hyperlink titled “Blogposts”.
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing I feel I have done successfully is the communicating of my character towards the audience. He is 
            quirky and passionate and I feel that that translates well through my website despite its much needed improvements. 

        </p>
        <p>
            I have yet to figure out how to appropriately convert my website to work beautifully both when using a mobile as
             well as when using a pc or other means of interactivity. I have successfully managed to hyperlink from the homepage
              to other pages; however I need to be able to do the same backwards.
        </p>
        <p>
            All in all, my UX and UI require a lot of improvement in order to be successful; however in terms of basics, it is
             easy to navigate through, even for non-internet savvy individuals.
