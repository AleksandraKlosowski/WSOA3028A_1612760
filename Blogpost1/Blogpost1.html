    <h1>First Blogpost!</h1>
    <p>When elaborating on the ideas and ideals of the internet; one could be referring <br> 
        to its overall vastness of information that appears to be limitless. Whereby all <br> of the worldâ€™s current knowledge is currently stored; and is continuously being updated. This continuous addition to the internet shows that although the internet appears limitless, as if to already contain every version of every piece of information.</p>
    <p>When looking at the Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges, this is suggesting that <br> 
        within this library, any possible word, phrase or combination within the English <br> language exists. This is done through multiple possibilities being created by trying out every possible variation created with the letters of the English language; showing us that every possible phrase, sentence or word already exists. This is similar to the internet by expressing its limitlessness and how there can never really be truly new information; even more so through the fact that one can actually google the library of babel and type any word/phrase on this page and will undeniably found that it will exist within this library. Scientists for example are continuously learning and expanding on their studies and thus contributing to the added information within the internet; however due to the limitlessness of the library of babel, ironically these new discoveries should already be within the library of babel since it contains every possible formula within the English language. Therefore, if the library of babel is already on the internet, there really can never be any new information, but rather exposed information that can already be found within this library. </p>
    <p>When looking at The Garden of Forking Paths by Jorge Luis Borges, one is looking at <br> 
        an elaborate maze, a labyrinth of sorts. It is said that the book itself not only <br> explains the philosophy of the vast variations of storylines but is also a maze itself, with its vast and endless interpretations. This is whereby a lot of stories and versions of a narrative exist simultaneously, as if to express vast timelines that could branch out dependant of ones choices, much like ones experience on the internet. Similarly the internet is a labyrinth; whereby depending on your keywords and choice of search, you will find various different pages and have a vast access to different types of knowledge. Just like the vast choices and routes one can take within a labyrinth; one similarly leads themselves through various paths on the internet dependant on what they click on, and where they try gain access to. One could end up with a nasty virus, or have successfully downloaded their pirated movie. The internet is vast and is expressive of how large the world of information and misinformation. As much as the world allows us to gain access to multitudes of studies and knowledge, it can easily deceive the public due to the fact that it equally contains false information. </p>
    <p>The main feature that perhaps makes the internet appear smaller and more censored is <br> 
        due to algorithms that will pop up the most searched sites and pages; where it will <br> filter out the less desired information that one can find by sifting through various pages such as within a Google search.</p>
