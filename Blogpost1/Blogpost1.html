    <p><h2>The importance of Accessibility</h2></p>
    <p>The web has become the most popularized form of medium, giving us access to vital <br> 
        resources that comprise of all the aspects within our lives. The web allows us to <br> 
        gain complete accessibility to various areas such as healthcare, schooling, looking <br> 
        for jobs, shopping online, entertainment and much more. Therefore it is vastly <br> 
        important that everyone has access to the internet. </p>
    <p>Having access to the web can assist various types of individuals such as those with <br> 
        disabilities and essentially can improve life’s experiences for everyone. The <br> 
        internet also allows us to find the easiest means of communication and allows us <br> 
        to communicate with others. This aids people who cannot physically go to a shop or <br> 
        struggle to read on more traditional mediums such as print.</p>
    <p>Arguably, the most vital and often overlooked aspects of businesses often include <br> 
        the lack of reachability for new customers due to a poor implementation of accessibility. <br> 
        A businesses success can be greatly affected by the usability and accessibility of a website. <br> 
        If customers cannot navigate through a website, it can be difficult to find the desired <br> 
        services or items. It can also potentially irritate and infuriate potential customers, <br> 
        often resulting in lost business. Furthermore, an inaccessible website can leave potential <br> 
        for legal issues. </p>
    <p>Often a websites accessibility is dependant of its user interface and its respective <br> 
        structure and design. Users should be able to search using keywords; and more specifically <br> 
        for businesses, have an ease at contacting the business should there be any questions or queries. <br> 
        The website should be structured in an aesthetic manner whereby many different types of clients <br> 
        have a pleasant experience, whether it be the elderly or a teenager. This is done through the use <br> 
        of headings, colours, icons, legible text, images, focus etc. </p>
    <p>The use of menus is also incredibly important. Menus should be easy to navigate through <br> 
        by using keywords of the most important webpages and accesses within the website, as only <br> 
        providing a search bar can be confusing and may result in a customer being unable to find <br> 
        desired items as well as being able to have a knowledge of what is being offered. It is <br> 
        through a websites functionality that develops a certain need and desire to use it. <br> 
        Functionality should be all inclusive in order for a wider sense of engagement. This can <br> 
        also be done by allowing the user to select a particular language in which one could display <br> 
        the webpage; there could also be an option that allows a shopper to select the country with <br> 
        which they reside which could show what is offered and available within their region; a further <br> 
        bonus would be converting the prices into the consumers currency for ease. </p>
    <p>All in all, accessibility is one of if not the most important access to any type of user <br> 
        and business.</p>

        <p><h2>The importance of Accessibility</h2></p>
        <p>
            This reading aside; the first thing one things of when it comes to digital inequalities <br>
            would/should perhaps be accessibility; this differs from country to country. Many individuals <br>
            do not have easy access to technology/ technological education and the internet. For example; <br>
            here in South Africa, the wealth gap is tremendously large, resulting in a larger poor population <br>
            that barely has access to clean water, let along digital technology. Furthermore we have power <br>
            outages which unless you are a part of the upper classes, with generators and solar power; you may <br>
            not have access to electricity all the time due to the municipality.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to Luts, there are three variations of a digital divide: the first-level, second-level <br>
            and third. Exactly how one presumes what the substance of this article would be; Lutz in fact covers it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the first-level-she evaluates research and how its focus has become more and more dependable upon <br>
            the studies of access, skills, uses and outcomes. She emphasizes the impotence of a digital divide; <br>
            perhaps even resulting in the replacement for humans for that of virtual means (virtual assistants).
        </p>
        <p>
            It is further emphasized how limited most people are to that of digital discourse; which is become <br>
            ever so important with each year and living in a technological age. It is also important due to its <br>
            easy accessibility and leisure as individuals are able to work from anywhere in the world in <br>
            whatever comfort they choose; whether it be at home, or in a coffee shop.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within the second-level of discussion with regards to digital divide, this mostly covers the digital <br>
            economy. It is through a digital inequalities scholarship that more focus and discussion has arisen <br>
            about digital skills and uses within an analytical perspective. One could navigate just how many <br>
            individuals have a basic understanding of algorithms through surveys and experiments in order to <br
            >understand just how ‘behind’ we are as a population.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of the third-level divide, Lutz discusses just how new the research within the inequalities <br>
            of the digital world is; however it has already been researched through various impactful means.<br>
            Thus being due to the considerations of technological access, skills and uses, but also the various <br>
            outcomes that result from the uses of technologies. It is equally as important to research both the <br>
            benefits and the harms of a technological world and more particularly, its consistent and constant evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite the thorough and multitudes of research given towards this topic; it is still underdeveloped <br>
            and understudied. It is clear that it requires far more time dedicated to it due to its importance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Its disadvantages are still ridiculously unbalanced and need to have more time and resources dedicated <br>
            to the narrowing of this divide.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, it is vital in a digital area, for all students and individuals to learn about the basic<br>
            vernaculars and understandings of technologies as well as being provided with access to it; realistically<br>
            this will be the most dependable means of survival as in terms of income and dependence as other jobs <br>
            are slowly deteriorating. This has become an ever true statement with Covid19 and its limitations.

        <h2>User Experience:</h2></p>
        <p>
            Hassenzahl and Tractinsky take a deep discussion into the understandings of user Experience and question <br>
            what exactly it is and entails. This took place through the analysis of three varying perspectives. With <br>
            all of these perspectives contributing equally to our understandings of user experience within the <br>
            technological world as it is known today. However, even with these three perspectives, the writers feel that<br>
             User Experience has not been sufficiently explain and described as it is far more intricate than we <br>
             often realize. User experience is arguably the most important part of web and software design. It is not <br>
             limited to needs that help us within our day to day lives; it is directly dependant on a user, including <br>
             and not limited to: needs, mood, motivation, expectations, technological discourse etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            They not only look at usability but also divulge into a world of context and setting with which the <br>
            interaction will occur. This results in a vast world of opportunities to forever improve and navigate through <br>
            needs, requirements and possible improvements in the creating of the very best website possible. The most <br>
            successful of user experiences make use of both investigation and practice. One cannot simply design a website<br>
            without understanding what a user expects to get out and experience from it. One can also not simply create a<br>
            website without testing it and making use of practice. We equally need to place ourselves in the user’s<br>
            shoes in order to relate to them most effectively and create the most successful website possible. As the <br>
            technological world evolves, so does user experience; this is with the introduction of sound, graphics, <br>
            updates etc. it is these constant improvements that require artists and coders to stay updated and challenge<br>
            ourselves by keeping up with the times and its respective expectations. Overall, this is what ultimately <br>
            improves functionality within the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also through this evolving system that there is a shift in expectations by developers, customers and users.<br>
            Interestingly enough; developers now need to have a relatively efficient understanding of psychology as well.<br>
            It is through this understanding that we allow ourselves to divulge into a user's perspective and ultimately <br>
            understand their overall experiences and therefore the effectiveness of a website. It also allows us to strive <br>
            for more positive user reactions and makes us more aware of how we might avoid negative ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, one could definitely argue that user experience is in fact the most vital role that plays within the <br>
            developing world of technology. Should a user have a negative or unsuccessful experience, they are unlikely to <br>
            visit the page again and can result in a loss or interest, interactivity and clients. Although we will strive for <br>
            an absence of negative experiences, it is equally if not more important to work towards improving quality of life <br>
            through ease and understanding of human limitations. This could be either by creating a user friendly website for <br>
            the elderly, children or the illiterate. Should there be opportunities to assist handicapable people, it would be <br>
            most important to do so. 
        </p>

        <h2 style="background-color: darkslategray;">Blogpost 8!!!</h2>
        <h2>My UX & UI:</h2></p>
        <p>
            User interface typically refers to the medium with which we designers create. This refers to both the <br>
            machines and the software one uses; this can be computers, laptops, cellular phones etc. its main purpose <br>
            and area of specialty would be the creating of ease in terms of usage by even the most inexperienced of <br>
            users and to increase their user experience through aesthetics. The goal is to make a design as simple and<br>
             effective as possible. This revolves around the term known as user-centred design. Appropriate user design <br>
             involves the use of fonts and formatting for appeal and easy legibility. The technical functions are just <br>
             as important as the appeal of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            User experience refers to the users overall interaction with the medium and their resulted experiences and <br>
            feelings. This is all about the user’s perception; how easy is it for them to use, how much does it appeal <br>
            to the eye, and does it communicate what is expected. User experience is more or less subjective and vague <br>
            than that of user interface. User experience is perhaps the most important thing when it comes to designing <br>
            a website. Once a website is made directly for a user’s needs, it is their experiences that make it most important.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of my websites user interface; I have used a laptop in order to create it, through the aid of Visual <br>
            Studio Code. Due to the accessibility to various type of coding capabilities; Visual Studio Code allows for <br>
            a large variety of ‘play’ and ‘interactivity’ with the software; allowing for vast variations of web design <br>
            and creative results. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My user experience however is in desperate need for improvement. Although my website is simple, and gets you <br>
            from one place to another, it does not allow a user to go back to previous home pages. The aesthetics are <br>
            amateur at best and I would like to make them more sleek and efficient through elegant typography and simple <br>
            designs. There are also vital gaps within my designs. I have not included contact information, or a home page <br>
            or even an appropriate setting for blogposts. (These comments are all with regards to my assignment 1 design <br>
            submission). My blogposts were each a link within a homepage whereas they should have all been easy to navigate <br>
            on a separate entirely that one could get to from the home page through a hyperlink titled “Blogposts”.
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing I feel I have done successfully is the communicating of my character towards the audience. He is <br>
            quirky and passionate and I feel that that translates well through my website despite its much needed improvements. 

        </p>
        <p>
            I have yet to figure out how to appropriately convert my website to work beautifully both when using a mobile as<br>
             well as when using a pc or other means of interactivity. I have successfully managed to hyperlink from the homepage<br>
              to other pages; however I need to be able to do the same backwards.
        </p>
        <p>
            All in all, my UX and UI require a lot of improvement in order to be successful; however in terms of basics, it is<br>
             easy to navigate through, even for non-internet savvy individuals.
