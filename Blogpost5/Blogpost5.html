    <p><h2>The importance of Accessibility</h2></p>
    <p>The web has become the most popularized form of medium, giving us access to vital <br> resources that comprise of all the aspects within our lives. The web allows us to gain complete accessibility to various areas such as healthcare, schooling, looking for jobs, shopping online, entertainment and much more. Therefore it is vastly important that everyone has access to the internet. </p>
    <p>Having access to the web can assist various types of individuals such as those with <br> disabilities and essentially can improve life’s experiences for everyone. The internet also allows us to find the easiest means of communication and allows us to communicate with others. This aids people who cannot physically go to a shop or struggle to read on more traditional mediums such as print.</p>
    <p>Arguably, the most vital and often overlooked aspects of businesses often include <br> the lack of reachability for new customers due to a poor implementation of accessibility. A businesses success can be greatly affected by the usability and accessibility of a website. If customers cannot navigate through a website, it can be difficult to find the desired services or items. It can also potentially irritate and infuriate potential customers, often resulting in lost business. Furthermore, an inaccessible website can leave potential for legal issues. </p>
    <p>Often a websites accessibility is dependant of its user interface and its respective <br> structure and design. Users should be able to search using keywords; and more specifically for businesses, have an ease at contacting the business should there be any questions or queries. The website should be structured in an aesthetic manner whereby many different types of clients have a pleasant experience, whether it be the elderly or a teenager. This is done through the use of headings, colours, icons, legible text, images, focus etc. </p>
    <p>The use of menus is also incredibly important. Menus should be easy to navigate through <br> by using keywords of the most important webpages and accesses within the website, as only providing a search bar can be confusing and may result in a customer being unable to find desired items as well as being able to have a knowledge of what is being offered. It is through a websites functionality that develops a certain need and desire to use it. Functionality should be all inclusive in order for a wider sense of engagement. This can also be done by allowing the user to select a particular language in which one could display the webpage; there could also be an option that allows a shopper to select the country with which they reside which could show what is offered and available within their region; a further bonus would be converting the prices into the consumers currency for ease. </p>
    <p>All in all, accessibility is one of if not the most important access to any type of user <br> and business.</p>
