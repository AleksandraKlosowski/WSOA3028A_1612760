    <p><h2>The importance of Accessibility</h2></p>
    <p>The web has become the most popularized form of medium, giving us access to vital <br> 
        resources that comprise of all the aspects within our lives. The web allows us to <br> 
        gain complete accessibility to various areas such as healthcare, schooling, looking <br> 
        for jobs, shopping online, entertainment and much more. Therefore it is vastly <br> 
        important that everyone has access to the internet. </p>
    <p>Having access to the web can assist various types of individuals such as those with <br> 
        disabilities and essentially can improve lifeâ€™s experiences for everyone. The <br> 
        internet also allows us to find the easiest means of communication and allows us <br> 
        to communicate with others. This aids people who cannot physically go to a shop or <br> 
        struggle to read on more traditional mediums such as print.</p>
    <p>Arguably, the most vital and often overlooked aspects of businesses often include <br> 
        the lack of reachability for new customers due to a poor implementation of accessibility. <br> 
        A businesses success can be greatly affected by the usability and accessibility of a website. <br> 
        If customers cannot navigate through a website, it can be difficult to find the desired <br> 
        services or items. It can also potentially irritate and infuriate potential customers, <br> 
        often resulting in lost business. Furthermore, an inaccessible website can leave potential <br> 
        for legal issues. </p>
    <p>Often a websites accessibility is dependant of its user interface and its respective <br> 
        structure and design. Users should be able to search using keywords; and more specifically <br> 
        for businesses, have an ease at contacting the business should there be any questions or queries. <br> 
        The website should be structured in an aesthetic manner whereby many different types of clients <br> 
        have a pleasant experience, whether it be the elderly or a teenager. This is done through the use <br> 
        of headings, colours, icons, legible text, images, focus etc. </p>
    <p>The use of menus is also incredibly important. Menus should be easy to navigate through <br> 
        by using keywords of the most important webpages and accesses within the website, as only <br> 
        providing a search bar can be confusing and may result in a customer being unable to find <br> 
        desired items as well as being able to have a knowledge of what is being offered. It is <br> 
        through a websites functionality that develops a certain need and desire to use it. <br> 
        Functionality should be all inclusive in order for a wider sense of engagement. This can <br> 
        also be done by allowing the user to select a particular language in which one could display <br> 
        the webpage; there could also be an option that allows a shopper to select the country with <br> 
        which they reside which could show what is offered and available within their region; a further <br> 
        bonus would be converting the prices into the consumers currency for ease. </p>
    <p>All in all, accessibility is one of if not the most important access to any type of user <br> 
        and business.</p>
