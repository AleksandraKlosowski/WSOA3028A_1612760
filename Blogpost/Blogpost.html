    <p>When elaborating on the ideas and ideals of the internet; one could be referring <br> 
        to its overall vastness of information that appears to be limitless. Whereby all <br> 
        of the worldâ€™s current knowledge is currently stored; and is continuously being updated. <br> 
        This continuous addition to the internet shows that although the internet appears <br> 
        limitless, as if to already contain every version of every piece of information.</p>
    <p>When looking at the Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges, this is suggesting that <br> 
        within this library, any possible word, phrase or combination within the English <br> 
        language exists. This is done through multiple possibilities being created by trying <br> 
        out every possible variation created with the letters of the English language; showing <br> 
        us that every possible phrase, sentence or word already exists. This is similar to <br> 
        the internet by expressing its limitlessness and how there can never really be truly <br> 
        new information; even more so through the fact that one can actually google the library <br> 
        of babel and type any word/phrase on this page and will undeniably found that it will <br> 
        exist within this library. Scientists for example are continuously learning and expanding <br> 
        on their studies and thus contributing to the added information within the internet; <br> 
        however due to the limitlessness of the library of babel, ironically these new <br> 
        discoveries should already be within the library of babel since it contains every <br> 
        possible formula within the English language. Therefore, if the library of babel is <br> 
        already on the internet, there really can never be any new information, but rather <br> 
        exposed information that can already be found within this library. </p>
    <p>When looking at The Garden of Forking Paths by Jorge Luis Borges, one is looking at <br> 
        an elaborate maze, a labyrinth of sorts. It is said that the book itself not only <br> 
        explains the philosophy of the vast variations of storylines but is also a maze itself, <br> 
        with its vast and endless interpretations. This is whereby a lot of stories and versions <br> 
        of a narrative exist simultaneously, as if to express vast timelines that could branch out <br> 
        dependant of ones choices, much like ones experience on the internet. Similarly the internet <br> 
        is a labyrinth; whereby depending on your keywords and choice of search, you will find various <br> 
        different pages and have a vast access to different types of knowledge. Just like the vast <br> 
        choices and routes one can take within a labyrinth; one similarly leads themselves through <br> 
        various paths on the internet dependant on what they click on, and where they try gain <br> 
        access to. One could end up with a nasty virus, or have successfully downloaded their <br> 
        pirated movie. The internet is vast and is expressive of how large the world of information <br> 
        and misinformation. As much as the world allows us to gain access to multitudes of studies <br> 
        and knowledge, it can easily deceive the public due to the fact that it equally contains <br> 
        false information. </p>
    <p>The main feature that perhaps makes the internet appear smaller and more censored is <br> 
        due to algorithms that will pop up the most searched sites and pages; where it will <br> 
        filter out the less desired information that one can find by sifting through various <br> 
        pages such as within a Google search.</p>
