    <p>When elaborating on the ideas and ideals of the internet; one could be referring <br> 
        to its overall vastness of information that appears to be limitless. Whereby all <br> 
        of the world’s current knowledge is currently stored; and is continuously being updated. <br> 
        This continuous addition to the internet shows that although the internet appears <br> 
        limitless, as if to already contain every version of every piece of information.</p>
    <p>When looking at the Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges, this is suggesting that <br> 
        within this library, any possible word, phrase or combination within the English <br> 
        language exists. This is done through multiple possibilities being created by trying <br> 
        out every possible variation created with the letters of the English language; showing <br> 
        us that every possible phrase, sentence or word already exists. This is similar to <br> 
        the internet by expressing its limitlessness and how there can never really be truly <br> 
        new information; even more so through the fact that one can actually google the library <br> 
        of babel and type any word/phrase on this page and will undeniably found that it will <br> 
        exist within this library. Scientists for example are continuously learning and expanding <br> 
        on their studies and thus contributing to the added information within the internet; <br> 
        however due to the limitlessness of the library of babel, ironically these new <br> 
        discoveries should already be within the library of babel since it contains every <br> 
        possible formula within the English language. Therefore, if the library of babel is <br> 
        already on the internet, there really can never be any new information, but rather <br> 
        exposed information that can already be found within this library. </p>
    <p>When looking at The Garden of Forking Paths by Jorge Luis Borges, one is looking at <br> 
        an elaborate maze, a labyrinth of sorts. It is said that the book itself not only <br> 
        explains the philosophy of the vast variations of storylines but is also a maze itself, <br> 
        with its vast and endless interpretations. This is whereby a lot of stories and versions <br> 
        of a narrative exist simultaneously, as if to express vast timelines that could branch out <br> 
        dependant of ones choices, much like ones experience on the internet. Similarly the internet <br> 
        is a labyrinth; whereby depending on your keywords and choice of search, you will find various <br> 
        different pages and have a vast access to different types of knowledge. Just like the vast <br> 
        choices and routes one can take within a labyrinth; one similarly leads themselves through <br> 
        various paths on the internet dependant on what they click on, and where they try gain <br> 
        access to. One could end up with a nasty virus, or have successfully downloaded their <br> 
        pirated movie. The internet is vast and is expressive of how large the world of information <br> 
        and misinformation. As much as the world allows us to gain access to multitudes of studies <br> 
        and knowledge, it can easily deceive the public due to the fact that it equally contains <br> 
        false information. </p>
    <p>The main feature that perhaps makes the internet appear smaller and more censored is <br> 
        due to algorithms that will pop up the most searched sites and pages; where it will <br> 
        filter out the less desired information that one can find by sifting through various <br> 
        pages such as within a Google search.</p>

        <p><b>1.</b>	Select a moment in the development of the www that you identify as important, <br> 
            research it and write about it. <br>
            •	I identify  Tim Berners-Lee’s founding of The World Wide Web Consortium in 1994 <br> 
            as a crucial and important part of web history. This is the publishing of ‘working <br>
            drafts’ by creators and developers. It is essentially reviewed by the online community <br> 
            and allows for commentary. This allows for bettering WD standards.  Benefits over <br>
            time have included faster downloading times, lower upkeep expenses, a wider access <br> 
            to users; including those with disabilities, more user friendly etc. <br>
            </p>
        <p><b>2.</b>	A reflection on one of the historical articles provided. <br>
            •	Alan Turing’s Computing Machinery and Intelligence work focuses on the consideration <br> 
            of the question “Can machines think?” and suggests that there is ultimately no substantial <br> 
            evidence supporting that machines cannot in fact think logically like humans. He believes that <br> 
            various methods can be taken in order to develop machine intelligence. <br> 
            Whilst I disagree that computers can currently think like humans, I do agree that we can <br> 
            pave the way for such advancements. Currently I believe that technology is not yet as advanced, <br> 
            simply consisting of keywords and coding in order to assist for human needs. <br>
            </p>
        <p><b>3.</b>	The promise and peril of User Generated Content. <br>
            •	The risks of user generated content may include the spill of content that companies <br> 
            have spent hard work time and money for when brands decide to run UGC campaigns. There <br> 
            can be a lack of authenticity as endorsement deals are increasingly featuring famous people, <br> 
            ultimately cheapening the world of advertising. There are various potential legal issues. <br> 
            There has increasingly been an abundance of using photos and work without permission. <br>
            •	The rewards of user generated content may include: an increase in web conversions, <br> 
            advertisement based UGC allows for a rise in click-thru rates, it can result in a rise <br> 
            of returning user’s time spent by users on the site may increase significantly etc. <br>
            </p>
        <p><b>4.</b>	The link between changing technology and the development and spread of internet culture <br> 
            (including but not limited to memes and fake news) <br>
            •	Changing technology has ultimately allowed for all different types of users to gain <br> 
            access and create their own content within the web itself. Due to an influx of such <br> 
            contributions, it has become impossible to prevent the spread of harmful and/or false <br> 
            news. Children and adolescents are gaining access to inappropriate media. There is also <br> 
            the dilemma of the dark web that is mainly used for illegal activity. <br>
            </p>
        <p><b>5.</b>	Research and decisions around URL structure <br>
            •	The Uniform Research Locator allows users to identify various addresses of certain <br> 
            documents/resources within the internet. They consist of various parts including protocols <br> 
            and domain names; allowing the browser to navigate and identify a resource. This not only <br> 
            creates unique URL’s that can simplify the searching of resources, but can also indicate <br> 
            the viability and safety of a website. <br>

        <p><b>1.</b>	Semantic Markup - what is it and why is it necessary <br>
            •	Semantic markup is a particular way in which one will structure and write <br> 
            their HTML coding in order to reinforce the division of etymology and logic <br> 
            involved with meaning. This in particular has to do with the content of the HTML <br> 
            as opposed to appearance. This is important as it allows one to navigate easily <br> 
            through their code and make effective changes when necessary. It is also particularly <br> 
            helpful when working with a team as it allows for others to navigate and understand <br> 
            your code within its content; essentially making it easy to distinguish between <br> 
            different types of data. <br>
            </p>
        <p><b>2.</b>	What is a browser? How do they work? <br>
            •	A browser is a computer program that contains a graphical user interface for <br> 
            the use of presenting and navigating between various web pages. More specifically <br> 
            it is an application software that provides a user with access to the World Wide Web. <br> 
            This application/browser retrieves wanted and searched for content from a web server <br> 
            and allows for the user to view it on their particular device whether it be a cell  phone, <br> 
            a laptop etc. <br>
            </p>
        <p><b>3.</b>	What are URLs and how do they work? <br>
            •	A URL or ‘Uniform Resource Locator’ is the address of a web page usually <br> 
            beginning with https:// for trustworthy and secure web pages. It is a reference <br> 
            to a web source that helps the user identify its location within a computer network <br> 
            and is a means of retrieving it. How it works is that it is a set of directions that <br> 
            can be interpreted through various platforms and they ultimately point and direct to <br> 
            a resource. This is done through a code-like language that consists of a protocol, a <br> 
            subdomain, a root domain, a top-level-domain, a subfolder, a file and a parameter; <br> 
            ultimately allowing the browser to navigate to the desired page. <br>
            </p>
        <p><b>4.</b>	A reflection on McLuhan, M. ‘The Medium is the Message’ <br>
            •	Mcluhan suggests that the class of a medium is vastly more significant than the <br> 
            meaning or substance of the message. He states that a ‘message’ is “the change of <br> 
            scale or pace or pattern” that it “introduces into human affairs.” Personally I agree <br> 
            with this statement as it provides the readers with an abundance of knowledge and <br> 
            communicates information. It informs us about what is happening globally and around us. <br>
            </p>
        <p><b>5.</b>	A reflection on Wardrip-Fruin, N. ‘What Hypertext Is’ <br>
            •	Wardrip-Fruin Nelson looks particularly at definitions constructed by Theodor Holm, <br> 
            the definitions being  “A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the <br> 
            Indeterminate”  and “‘Hypertext’ means forms of writing which branch or perform on <br> 
            request; they are best presented on computer display screens... Discrete, or chunk <br> 
            style, hypertexts consist of separate pieces of text connected by links.” (Holm in Nelson pg 127) <br>
            
            This is particularly true as hypertext overall is when text is displayed on the screen <br> 
            of a computer or alternative electronic device and references other texts that can be <br> 
            accessed instantly by the reader. <br>

        <p><h3>1.	How does the Medium is the Message impact our understanding of the web?</h3></p>
        <p>Marshal McLuhan’s work, The Medium is the Message demonstrates to readers how artefacts as media <br> 
            have the capability to influence any society by their attributes or substance.</p>
        <p>It essentially influences and provides clarity for us, the web designers as to how we can approach <br> 
            the design of the web in the most appealing and functional way possible. It allows us to make <br> 
            thought through and educated decisions on what medium would be best suited for our audiences and <br> 
            intentions. For example; one would look for the most efficient browser that has sufficient speed <br> 
            in order to create a more desirable and user friendly experience. </p>
        <p>The browser would also need to be well known, or well-advertised in order to encourage users or to <br> 
            receive an adequate flow of visibility whereby users can easily find our webpages. It also helps us <br> 
            understand user experiences through different mediums such as through film versus the web, as film <br> 
            is more linear, whereby users participate and experience it from beginning to middle to end; however <br> 
            the web is seldom experienced through a linear experience, the user is in more control as to where <br> 
            they want to go, what they want to see and ultimately can navigate directly to what they came for. <br> 
            It is entirely up to the user how they decide to experience and consume the information being provided. </p>
        <p>Another thing whilst looking at medium is accessibility. One can also look at the web not only as a <br> 
            medium, but as a message: users can now access the web globally and from anywhere within the comfort <br> 
            of their own home; unlike newspapers that prove to be far more restrictive whereby readers will have <br> 
            to wait for delivery and accessibility is far more circumstantial; however I this day and age, one <br> 
            can gain access to news instantly, as soon as the article has been publishes. Through the use of <br> 
            computers and cell phones, one can also dictate the brightness and use filters such as the ‘blue light’ <br> 
            filter for further comfort. </p>
        <p>Most importantly, web designers have the capability to produce tools, experiences, services and <br> 
            societies due to the medium that is being used. Historically, no other medium to date has the <br> 
            capability to reach as many individuals on such a global scale. It forces us designers to account <br> 
            and keep in mind its accessibility, reach and immediate gratification. </p>
        <p>As designers we need to look at the best means of delivering information dependant of the job or <br> 
            assignment given. Through the use of the web, a small store can gain far more coverage and an <br> 
            access to a wider group of clients; however in a small town of mostly elderly individuals that <br> 
            are not technologically sufficient, the newspaper may be a greater form of communicating to <br> 
            potential, nearby clients.</p>
